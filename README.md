# DiskQuotaCleanup is a tiny utility to cleanup unused big folder to reduce disk usage
This is developed for self-study to learn Eto.Forms library.

This project is beta and under development(not maintained well).

I will run in Windows (Wpf), MacOS, and Linux (cross-platform).

DiskQuotaCleanup can
1) Summarize the disk usage for selected folder.
2) Display usage graphically.
3) Export summary to Excel(*.xlsx)
3) Remove selected folder.
